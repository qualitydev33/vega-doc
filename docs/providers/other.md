# Other Data Sources

## Overview

The Vega Platform supports collecting data from a variety of sources including Datadog, Snowflake, and more. Some data sources are persistent and ongoing, and others require a one-time integration for data enrichment (e.g. backfilling historical data, business unit mapping). Please reach out to your Vega FinOps analyst to discuss your specific needs and to onboard these datasources.
