# Users
Found under *Settings* > *Users*

The Vega Platform allows users who have been granted the necessary role access to invite new users, as well as edit or delete existing users within their organization from the Platform system.

Additionally, users with the proper role access can manage the roles assigned to users in their organization to ensure everyone has the desired levels of access within the Platform.

This page also allows users to view when a user was created, filter the users within their organization, and be provided a visual indicator if the user is currently active, pending invite, etc.

**Note**: Please note that if your organization uses SSO, you will not be able to manage users in the platform. You will need to manage users in your SSO provider.
