# Roles and Permissions


### About Roles and Permissions
The Vega  Platform follows best practices for role-based access control (RBAC). RBAC is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In the Vega Platform, roles are assigned to users and permissions are assigned to roles. This allows for a flexible and scalable method of managing access to the Vega Platform.

The following roles are available in the Vega Platform:

| Role | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
