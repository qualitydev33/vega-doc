### About Anomalies
Vega's anomaly detection functionality provides businesses with a comprehensive tool to monitor and analyze their expenditure patterns in real-time. By employing advanced algorithms and data analytics, this dashboard swiftly identifies and flags any irregularities or deviations from established spending norms. Such anomalies might suggest inefficiencies, unexpected charges, or even fraudulent activities. By detecting these variances early on, organizations are empowered to take proactive measures, ensuring optimal financial management and safeguarding their resources. The intuitive visual representation of data on these dashboards also facilitates quick decision-making, enabling businesses to maintain control over their financial health and drive cost efficiencies.
