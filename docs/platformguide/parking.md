## About Parking

Cloud's metered usage offers the benefit of only paying for resources when in use, however a common challenge faced by many organizations is identifying, orchestrating, and enforcing the means for powering off resources that do not require persistent runtimes (e.g. test and dev environments). 

Vega Parking is a cloud scheduling software designed to optimize cloud resource utilization and minimize costs through the automation of powering off and on cloud resources. With Parking, users are able to set and assign schedules according to their anticipated run patterns using a simple user interface to avoid generating unnecessary waste without a complicated workflow.
