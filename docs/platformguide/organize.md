#  Organize

## About Organize
The Vega Platform providers a powerful but easy to use solution for organizing cloud spend across multiple clouds, mapping your cloud spend to your business, and managing your spend across multiple teams. Powered by patented technology called **Spaces**, the Vega Platform allows you to organize your cloud spend in a way that makes sense for your business, defined by your organizational structure.

### Spaces
Spaces, our patented organizational model, allows you to define hierarchical structures that map to your business. Spaces act as the top-level organizational structure in the Vega Platform.  Spaces can be defined by any attribute, such as environment or cost center.  Spaces contain one or more workloads. An example of a Space might be an environment, cost center, or a project.

### Workloads
Workloads are the second-level organizational structure in the Vega Platform. Workloads are defined by any attribute, such as application, environment, or service. Workloads are nested within Spaces. Workloads contain one or more resource pools that make up a workload. An example of a workload might be a web application, a database, or a microservice.

### Resource Pools
Resource Pools are the third-level organizational structure in the Vega Platform.   Resource Pools contain one or more resources. Resource Pools are nested within workloads.

### Resources
Resources are the fourth-level organizational structure in the Vega Platform, and are the lowest level organizational structure in the Vega Platform.
Resources are nested within resource pools, and are the actual cloud resources that are being monitored and managed by the Vega Platform.

### Business Groupings
Business Groupings are a way to limit the scope of access to the Vega Platform. Business Groupings are a collection of users and a business grouping may be identified as a team, department, or any other business unit. Business Groupings are used to limit the scope of access to the Vega Platform.
