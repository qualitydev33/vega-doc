### About Business Groupings
Business groupings allow you to organize different units for access and reporting purposes. Creating a business grouping provides you the capability to add users to the group, define its business grouping type, and with the assistance of your Vega FinOps analyst, limit the scope of data access and dashboard views. Users may be added to multiple business groupings and may be removed from a business grouping at any time.

### Creating a Business Grouping
Business groupings can be created by clicking the `Create Business Grouping` button in the top right corner of the business groupings page. This will open the create business grouping dialog.

**Note**: When creating a new business group, no users are assigned. Users may be added or removed from the business group by selecting users then clicking the < or > buttons in the user list. All users may be added or removed by clicking the >> or << buttons in the user list.

### Default Business Grouping
Your account will have a Default Business grouping that is created when your account is provisioned. This business grouping will have all users assigned to it by default. This business grouping cannot be deleted.

### Deleting a Business Grouping
Business groupings cannot be deleted at this time. If you would like to delete a business grouping, please contact your Vega FinOps analyst.
